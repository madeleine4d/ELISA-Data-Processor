# ELISA Data Processor

This script is meant to work with any Gen5 compatible plate readers. It is able to import .csv and excel type files (.xlsx). It is very unlikely to work with any files not formatted the same as Gen5 output files.

To use:
 - review the code
 - install pandas, colorama, pathlib if you do not have them
 - download and run with python3
 - follow text prompts and give input
 - Output is given as a .csv and must be labeled as such when you are naming the output file

I would also recommend that you place the files you want to process in the same folder as the script. This way you can use relative path to input and output files.
